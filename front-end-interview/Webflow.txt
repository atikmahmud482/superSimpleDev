✅ Technical Questions & Answers (Webflow + Frontend)
1. Q: What is Webflow and why do you prefer it?
A: Webflow is a visual development tool that allows building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without writing code directly. I prefer it because it gives pixel-perfect control, dynamic CMS, and clean code export. It also speeds up development and allows for quick client feedback.

2. Q: How do you handle responsive design in Webflow?
A: I use Webflow’s built-in responsive breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile landscape & portrait). I ensure layouts use Flexbox or Grid for flexibility, use relative units (%, em, rem), and test on multiple devices.

3. Q: Explain the difference between a Collection and a Static Page in Webflow.
A: Static Pages are designed individually, while Collection Pages are dynamic templates powered by CMS content. For example, a blog post page pulls data from the “Blog” collection.

4. Q: How do you optimize a Webflow site for performance?
A:

Compress images before upload

Use WebP or SVG when possible

Enable lazy loading

Minimize interactions & animations

Reduce unused styles and scripts

Use Webflow’s built-in SEO settings

5. Q: Can you integrate custom code in Webflow?
A: Yes. Webflow allows adding custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript using the Embed element, page settings, or the project settings (Head/Footer). I use it for third-party scripts, animations, or advanced interactions.

6. Q: How do you handle CMS-driven pages in Webflow?
A: I create a Collection, set the necessary fields (title, image, slug, etc.), then design a Collection Page Template that dynamically populates with data. For custom layouts, I use conditional visibility and filters.

7. Q: Have you used interactions and animations in Webflow?
A: Yes. I use Webflow Interactions 2.0 to create animations like fade-ins, scroll effects, and hover states — ensuring performance-friendly and responsive transitions.
