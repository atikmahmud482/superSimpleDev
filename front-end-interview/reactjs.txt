ðŸ“˜ React.js Interview Notes (Quick & Practical)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is React?
Library (not framework) for building UI.

Developed by Facebook, based on components and JSX.

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}

ðŸ”¹ 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
Looks like HTML, but it's syntactic sugar for React.createElement.

Must return a single parent element.

const element = <div>Hello, {name}</div>;

ðŸ”¹ 3. Components
Functional Components (most common now)

Props: Pass data from parent to child

function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h2>Hello, {name}</h2>;
}
