Zustand is a fast, simple, and scalable state management library for React. It's lighter than Redux and easier to set up, making it a popular choice for frontend developers who want global state without boilerplate.

🐻 What is Zustand?
Zustand (German for state) lets you create global state using a minimal API — no reducers, no actions, no context boilerplate.

✅ Why Use Zustand?
Zero boilerplate

Built-in support for React hooks

React-free store (you can use it outside components)

Partial updates with selective re-renders

Ideal for both small and large applications

🚀 Basic Usage
1. Install
npm install zustand
# or
yarn add zustand

2. Create a Store
// store.js
import { create } from 'zustand';

const useBearStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  reset: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}));
