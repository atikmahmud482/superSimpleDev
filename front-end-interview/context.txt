In React, Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It‚Äôs useful for global data like authentication status, themes, or user preferences.

üß† Why use React Context?
To avoid "prop drilling" (passing props through multiple layers).

To manage global state more cleanly.

To share values between deeply nested components.

üõ† How to Use Context in React
1. Create the Context

import React, { createContext } from 'react';

export const ThemeContext = createContext();

2. Provide the Context (in a parent component)
export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const theme = 'dark'; // or use useState/useReducer for dynamic values

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
You typically wrap your app (or a part of it) in this provider:
import { ThemeProvider } from './ThemeContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <YourComponent />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

3. Consume the Context (in any child component)
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './ThemeContext';

const ThemedComponent = () => {
  const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <div>The current theme is {theme}</div>;
};

üß∞ When to Use Context vs Other State Management Tools
Use Case	                               Suggested Tool
Theme, auth, language	                   Context API
Complex global state, performance sensitive	Redux / Zustand / Jotai
Local component state	                    useState or useReducer

‚ö†Ô∏è Tips
Don't overuse context for frequently changing values ‚Äî it may cause unnecessary re-renders.

Combine with useReducer or useState for more dynamic contexts.
