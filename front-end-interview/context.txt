In React, Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Itâ€™s useful for global data like authentication status, themes, or user preferences.

ðŸ§  Why use React Context?
To avoid "prop drilling" (passing props through multiple layers).

To manage global state more cleanly.

To share values between deeply nested components.
